# ES6/ES2015 Samples
==========

A set of ECMAScript 2015 (also called ES6) examples as well as a Gulp file that converts them to ES5 using Babel.

## To run the samples:

1. Install Node.js

2. Run `npm install`

3. Run `gulp` to transpile ES6 to ES5 (leave the window open since it watches for file changes)

4. Open another console window and run `npm start` to launch the browser
